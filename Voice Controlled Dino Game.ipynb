    "We have all been in a situation where we didn’t have access to the internet and to pass time we started playing the Google Dino game. However, the game tends to get a little monotonous with all the key presses and the biggest fear is that if we regain the internet connection, we might lose the progress, especially if we are about to beat a high score. Therefore, for our final project, we wanted to create our own version of the Dino game using the PIC32 microcontroller and the TFT screen which can be controlled with our voice. That way, we could play the game any time we wanted without the fear of losing progress by regaining the internet connection.\n",

    "The game begins with a start screen with very minimal text saying `Press Start!`. Once the start button is pressed, the screen updates and the game starts. The game is fairly straightforward with a dino player running. The main task of the game is to keep jumping over obstacles (cactii) and not die. As long as the player is alive, the game keeps on running and generating newer obstacles.\n",
    "\n",
    "In order to control the dino, the user can use the `Jump` button which updates the `y-velocity` of the dino and makes it jump. Once the dino has jumped, the gravity acts on it and its velocity changes each frame. Once the diono hits the ground again, the velocity is reset to 0. Whistling into the microphone can also make the dino jump. Once the dino passes an obstacle, the score is incremented.\n",
    "\n",

    "\n",
    "Sound is a continuous signal. In order to input this continuous signal to the microcontroller, we sample it using the ADC. The rate at which we sample the sound determines the range of frequencies we can recover. The Nyquist–Shannon sampling theorem says that the faster we sample the input signal at, the higher the range of the frequencies we can recover. The basic thing to consider while sampling the signal is: $f_{s} \\geq 2 \\times f_{highest}$\n",
    "\n",
    "Where $f_{s}$ is the sampling frequency and $f_{highest}$ is the highest frequency, we need to recover. In our project, we used this relation to calculate the frequency at which the timer should interrupt the flow of the program in order to read the audio input to recover the whistle sound."

    "Once the audio signal is sampled and broken into N discrete time points, we need to use the Discrete Time Fourier Transform to convert the signal into a discrete number of N frequency signals. The DTFT takes in a real valued argument and an imaginary valued argument. Since we are dealing with sound signals, we only need to concern ourselves with the real valued argument. The discrete-time Fourier transform of a discrete sequence of real or complex numbers x[n], for all integers n, is a Fourier series, which produces a periodic function of a frequency variable. When the frequency variable, ω, has normalized units of radians/sample, the periodicity is 2π, and the Fourier series is:\n",

A point to remember is that we had to use fixed point arithmetic in order to make our calculations faster as floating-point arithmetic is quite CPU intensive and slow."

    "\n",
    "When we compute the FFT of a particular segment of the sound signal, the algorithm assumes that the input to it is a periodic sound signal. In case of a periodic sound signal, the signal would be continuous over the entire time domain. However, our signal is not periodic, and thus, if we apply a fast Fourier transform on it, then we would get sharp high frequency components in our frequency domain. To avoid this, we used a windowing function which would smooth out the signal between different segments. In our case, each segment consisted of 512 samples.\n",
    "\n",
    "There are various window functions available to choose from. We chose to use the Hann window, which is a cosine-based window function. When we apply a window function, we basically divide the window into the number of samples in our segment, and then multiply every nth sample of the audio signal with the nth sample in the window function. The equation of the Hann window is given below, where N is the total samples in each segment (512 in our case).\n",

    "For audio input, we used the built-in analog to digital converter in the PIC32 microcontroller. The ADC has a 10-bit resolution, which means that the 0-3.3V input audio signal amplitude will be resolved into 1024 different values, which means that the microcontroller will read the audio signal with a 3.2mV resolution. The pin we are using to read the ADC input is AN11. The input analog signal is passed onto a sample and hold signal, and at the sampling frequency set, the sample and hold signal converts the analog value to a 10bit digital value and places it in the ADC1BUF0. We then fetch this value from this register and compute FFT once we have 512 values. In our audio sample, there will be a DC noise present. To filter this out, we connected a basic RC high pass filter at the input of the ADC. The filter consists of a 1uF capacitor, and a 10k resistor in the configuration shown in the circuit diagram below. This gives us a cutoff frequency of about 16 Hz.  Also, since our input will be -2V to 2V, we also apply a bias at the input of the ADC to shift our signal up by 1.65V."

    "- Define a `byteWidth` and counter variables `i` & `j`.\n",
    "- For all the elements in the given bitmap, check if the given pixel is set.\n",

    "- Configure the row address.\n",
    "- Configure the column address.\n",
    "- Send the color to be drawn with.\n",

    "- For all the pixels, send the color to be drawn with.\n",

    "This function is extremely optimized as we need to set the address window only once. Therefore, we combined the two functions to create a new function called `drawBitmap()` which takes in the same set of arguments as the `tft_drawBitmap()` function (and is therefore interchangeable). It was implemented as follows:\n",
    "- Set the boundary condition for the rectangle.\n",
    "- Set the address window.\n",

    "Our final dino game works exactly as we expected it to and follows everything we outlined in the final project proposal. We met all the goals we outlined and the game behaved exactly as we expected it to in the demo. If we were to do this project again, we would add additional flash memory to make the game more complex. We would like to add extra sounds, maybe even birds for the dino to duck under.\n",
